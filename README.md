Here's a `README.md` file to help you set up and run the password validation project:

```md
# Password Validator App

A React-based web application to validate passwords from text files based on specific rules. Users can upload `.txt` files or manually input passwords for validation.

## Features
- **Drag and Drop**: Upload `.txt` files by dragging them into the dropzone.  
- **Manual Input**: Paste passwords directly into the textarea.  
- **File Validation**: Validate passwords based on rules specified in the file.  
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Displays results for each line, indicating if the password is valid or not.

## Usage
1. **File Upload**:  
   Drag and drop one or more `.txt` files into the drop area. The app will process and validate passwords based on the rules provided in the files.  

2. **Manual Validation**:  
   Paste password data directly into the textarea and click "Validate Passwords" to check validity.  

3. **Validation Rules**:  
   Each line in the file should follow the format:  
   ```
   a 1-3: abcde
   ```
   - `a` – character to validate  
   - `1-3` – minimum and maximum occurrences of the character  
   - `abcde` – password to check  

---

## Example
### Input (file or textarea):
```
a 1-3: abcde
b 1-5: bbbbb
c 2-4: cdefg
```

### Output:
```
✅ a 1-3: abcde
✅ b 1-5: bbbbb
❌ c 2-4: cdefg
```
- Valid passwords are marked with ✅  
- Invalid passwords are marked with ❌
